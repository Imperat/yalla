# yalla
Yalla js is a framework for building web applications that prioritize unidirectional data flow by using the concept of 
"stateless components" with "state container".

# 5 reasons why using yallajs
## 1. Be stateless instead statefull
### Easy to Understand
When you build stateless components, you just build a function that returns the UI template. So much for the simple you 
can easily understand because you only read line by line until it closed. There is no binding, no two-way-binding, 
just a pure function that returns a UI template.

Remember when you build the server side ui (php / servlet), your UI generated from the beginning to the end of the 
file / method. It is simple to understand

## 2. Unidirectional data flow is a KING

## 3. Routing should be damn Simple

## 4. It should be fast, but don't ignore Memory

## 5. If everything is javascript, why choose something else


In other words, with yallajs you build stateless functional components, with state container also known as store 
and routing management which based on package management,and templating using jsonml.
